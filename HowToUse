This is the pipeline for two purposes:Predict phenotype from genotype and predict phenotype from existing phenotype.
Thanks to Haoyuan's contribution to liftover and conversion to VCF  (codes were slightly different from Haoyuan's original scripts)

I.Genotype to Phenotype, based on GWAScatalog data
1.Use 23andMetoPrediction2.R
2.The input data will be 23andMe raw files in .Zip format 
3.commandline Rscsript 23andMetoPrediction2.R [PatientID] [InputFileAddress][OutputAddress]
4.The ourput will be in csv format 


II. Phenotype to phenotype , based Zhao et al. 2014 (Barabasi group) disease networks 

1.Use survey data from patients 
2. Input is in csv. format , example shown in 'Fakeinputdata' folder
3.commandline Rscript PredictDiseasePip.R [InputFileAddress] [PatientID]
4.Output will be in .csv format. 

III.VEP based prediction. 
1.In progress, recent updates of VEP make it incompatable with pakcages.Himanshu is working on his veriso of it in paralell with Dianbo
