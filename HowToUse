#Updated on 23rd Aug 2017 

This is the pipeline for two purposes:Predict phenotype from genotype and predict phenotype from existing phenotype.
Thanks to Haoyuan's contribution to liftover and conversion to VCF  (codes were slightly different from Haoyuan's original scripts)


I. raw 23andMe data to VCFs 
1.The input data will be 23andMe raw files in .Zip format 
2.Rscript RawFileToVCFs.R [PaitentID] [Input_Zip_file] [OutputAddress]
3.The ourput will be in csv format 

II.Genotype to Phenotype, based on GWAScatalog data
1.Rscript  VCFToPredictions2.R [PaitentID] [Input_Zip_file] [OutputAddress] 
2.The ourput will be in csv format 


III. Phenotype to phenotype , based Zhao et al. 2014 (Barabasi group) disease networks 

1.Use survey data from patients 
2. Input is in csv. format , example shown in 'Fakeinputdata' folder
3.commandline Rscript PhenotypebasedPrediction.R [PatientID] [InputFileAddress] [OutputAddress]
4.Output will be in .csv format. 

III.VEP based prediction. 
1.In progress, recent updates of VEP make it incompatable with pakcages.Himanshu is working on his veriso of it in paralell with Dianbo




Other Notes:
1.Imputation of SNPs hasn't been used yet, Haoyuan is working on a more efficeint version 
2. 23andMe data can be used now. The pipline can be adapted to Ancestry data very quickly if needed
3.Be careful of R version because the packages sometimes depend on the version 
4. Other more sophisticated predcition algorithm are in the progress of being implemented.
